The goal of this project is to make a simplified clone of AirBnb.

We worked on this project in a team of 5 and had one week to do it.

## Team Goals

1. Better TDD 
2. Solving in the simplest way possible
3. Having a clear understanding of the MVC - Domain Modelling
4. Learning how to work off of git branching - Teamwork
5. XP techniques - Keeping everyone on the same page!
6. Everyone's happy!

## Planning

We used a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/2ga0OPTw/makers-bnb) to help delegate roles each day and write a to do list of tickets that we wanted to get done. 
We used GitHub issues for tickets.

## Tech

Ruby, Sinatra, Rspec, Capybara, PostgreSQL

## Approach

As a team we decided that we wanted to focus on learning and developing our skills and took a quality over quantity approach. 

Something that was important to us was making sure that everyone on the team understood all of the code. To facilitate this we would have a stand up in the morning to decide what tickets would be worked on that day and then we had a team retro in the afternoon to review work, merge our GitHub branches and explain the code to anyone in the team who felt that they didn't understand how a certain feature worked or why the code had been written in a certain way.

We followed an agile work flow and used GitHub issues to break tasks down into tickets. We split into one pair and one group of three and rotated this every day so that we would all have an opportunity to work with different people in the group and so that everyone could work on every feature. In our morning stand ups we would decide which was the more challenging ticket of the day and this would be given to the group of three, whilst the less challenging ticket would be taken on by the pair.
